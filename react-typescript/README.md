# Github Pages Template
A template to copy to make a react typescript project for github pages

## Web Quick Start

Visit the [web page located on github pages](https://keeganw.github.io/templates/react-typescript). This is running from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Development Setup

1. Install Node and NPM for your OS using [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or brew on Mac (`brew install node`)
1. In the root directory of the cloned project, run `npm i`
1. Once it is done, you can start the development server with `npm start`. If a web page is not automatically opened, go to [localhost:3000/templates/react-typescript](http://localhost:3000/templates/react-typescript)

## Using the Tool

Copy this code to a new directory, and get started with your own changes

## Pushing Changes to Github Pages

Using react's `gh-pages` you can simply run the below command to deploy to your github page.
```bash
npm run deploy
```
